<!-- ems = these are not like font-size: 10px; they are not pixels, as pixels assumes that the users screens are a similar size to yours. What if the user is using a very different sized screen, like a smartphone? 
Ems are not to be confused with html's <em> italics tag, they are very different. 
An em is used with font-size and is a relative measure. One em is equal to the default font size on whatever screen the user is using. So rather than telling the screen what font you wish to use, it works out what is relative to that device. It says "if one em is the font size that you usually use, then 2em would be twice as big and 0.5em would be half that size."
